# Pour-Over Coffee Notes #

## Measurement table ##

| Output water (ml) | Coffee (g) |
|------------------:|-----------:|
|               320 |         20 |
|               480 |         30 |

Notes:

-   Prefer 1:16 coffee to water
-   Coffee weighed with 0.01g accuracy scale (something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Pocket-Scale-Jewelry-Medicinal/dp/B07CZ8BFDZ/ref=sr_1_43?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1538407907&sr=1-43&keywords=small+scale))
-   Sadly, main weighing scales destroyed; small ones generally do not have the capacity (classic capacity/accuracy tradeoff). Target volume measured by physical reference points: knowledge of mug size, or nub on Chemex
-   (Therefore) Water volume measured on output, not input

## Preparation ##

-   I use a V60 glass holder (with plastic handle removed) within the Chemex body

-   Collect
    +   Scale + Chemex + V60 + V60 filter
    +   Grinder
    +   Coffee
    +   Mugs
-   Brew water to 93Â°C (set to hold if desired)

## Instructions for brewing ##

1.  Place filter within V60; Rinse V60, filter and Chemex with cold water (often while kettle is heating up)
2.  Tare the scale, measure desired bean quantity, move to grinder
3.  Grind
4.  Rinse V60 and filter with hot water
5.  Add grounds to filter
6.  Pour between 5/3 and 2 times water to coffee
7.  Stir and wait 15 seconds (less if draining very fast, more if very slow)
8.  Pour water to just under target weight, aiming for coin-sized concentric circle pour
9.  Pour water to wash down edges of grounds build-up
